# Dizzy from Beyblade
First iteration of an attemp to bring the character Dizzy from Beyblade to life. Early in development and for the time being just carries out some basic interactions and plays music. More features will be added in the coming months. 

In line 18 of Dizzy_V1.py, change the words in the list based on what the speech recognition library interprets whenever you call her name. Everytime I say "Dizzy", one of these words is what it understands, probably due to my accent.
